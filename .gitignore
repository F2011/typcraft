# This .gitignore is appropriate for repositories deployed to GitHub Pages and using

.jekyll-cache/

# Additional Ruby/bundler ignore for when you run: bundle install
/vendor

# Specific ignore for GitHub Pages
# GitHub Pages will always use its own deployed version of pages-gem 
# This means GitHub Pages will NOT use your Gemfile.lock and therefore it is
# counterproductive to check this file into the repository.
